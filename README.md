# threejs-snippets-vscode
Collection of snippets for Three.js, formatted for Visual Studio Code, with tab stops and whatnot.


Shamelessly used [blackjk3's Sublime Text Snippets for Three.js](https://github.com/blackjk3/threejs-sublime) and [devertâ€™s Atom Snippets for Three.js](https://github.com/devert/atom-threejs-snippets)as the basis.
